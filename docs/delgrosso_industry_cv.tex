I also designed and implemented a job{-}scheduling web application, implementing lean management methods to decrease data collection waiting times for 40 users and trained and mentored several biology and bioinformatics researchers in Python programming methods and open{-}source collaboration workflows, as well as gave introductory programming workshops for over 150 researchers.}%
\NewEntry{May 2013 {-}\newline%
  Nov 2018}{Ludwig{-}Maximillians Universitaet}{Prof. Dr. Anton Sirota}{Programmed a 3D graphics engine in Python to build virtual reality system for freely moving rats, supervised students in programming, engineering, and cognitive science projects, organized weekly journal clubs, and ordered new equipment, trained rodents to perform behavioral tasks, and performed surgery on said rodents as part of brain research.}%
\NewEntry{Aug 2012 {-}\newline%
  May 2013}{Universitaet Tuebingen}{Prof. Dr. Christoph Braun}{Wrote a research grant to study the top{-}down and bottom{-}up interactions by computational modeling information propagation in early sensory pathways as measured by MEG, designed and administrated an institute wiki, organized a student lecture series, and supervised two students’ EEG research projects.}%
\NewEntry{Nov 2011 {-}\newline%
  July 2012}{Universitaet Tuebingen}{Prof. Dr. Niels Birbaumer}{Programmed in Matlab a time{-}frequency and evoked potential analysis on three years’ worth of MEG data assessing longitudinal changes in stroke patients receiving physiotherapy.}%
\SubHeading{Industry Experience}%
\NewEntry{}{Freelance Data Analysis Programming Trainer}{.}{I teach week{-}long programming workshops for research institutes, universities, and private companies.}%
\NewEntry{}{Freelance Scientific Consultant}{UKT Psychosomatic Med. and Sports Med.}{I evaluated and designed a solution for performing medical science studies in a placebo study, and taught the PhD student who carried out the study over several remote sessions and a few travel consultations.}%
\NewEntry{}{Research Internship}{The Neuromarketing Labs}{I completed set{-}up of an EEG laboratory, including software calibration and noise measurements. Designed and ran two experiments estimating the evoked responses of semantic agreement and price agreement, then analyzed the data. The results from the second experiment are the basis of Dr. Mueller’s recently{-}published book, "Neuropricing". Currently volunteering as an EEG consultant by giving one{-}day workshops on Fieldtrip, SPM, and artifact correction methods.}%
\SubHeading{Teaching Experience}%
\NewEntry{April 2019}{Trainer}{The Python Tsunami}{In this compressed version of the "Intro. to Python" course, I led 100 biology students and 6 instructors in a conference{-}style 2{-}day course that culminated in a data jam showcasing their new programming and data analysis skills.}%
\NewEntry{March 2019}{Trainer}{Computer Graphics for Virtual Reality}{Taught Object{-}Oriented Programming methdology in the context of designing a 3D Graphics library, including 3D matrix multiplication, shader graphics, and event loop programming.}%
\NewEntry{August 2018}{Trainer}{Int. Scientific Programming in Python}{A 4{-}day workshop on good programming practices essential for writing robust, reusable Python code for scientific data analysis.  Covered object{-}oriented programming, advanced iteration and automation structures in Python, performance profiling, testing, and packaging code.  Throughout each unit, I emphasized idiomatic code style, good coding practices, and problem{-}solving strategies.}%
\NewEntry{July 2018}{Programming Instructor}{Teaching Statistics with R}{This 4{-}day workshop is an intensive R course taught to the Psychology department professors at Kwantlen University in Vancouver, Canada.  In this course, they learned the R programming language and how to build statistics teaching materials with it.}%
\NewEntry{April 2018 {-} Present}{Organizer}{Munich Science Slam}{Co{-}founded a tri{-}monthly science slam event series, working with 10{-}14 speakers from various institutes to give talks in a competion format.  At the end of each event, I demonstrate a real{-}time evaluation system into the event for the 60 audience members to use for feedback.}%

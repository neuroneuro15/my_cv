\NewEntry{Aug 2012}{M.Sc. Neuroscience}{Max Planck International Research School, Graduate School of Neural and Behavioural Sciences}{}%
\NewEntry{May 2010}{B.Sc. Psychology}{Wittenberg University}{}%
\SubHeading{Teaching Experience}%
\NewEntry{October 2017}{3D Graphics Instructor}{Animal Tracking and VR Bootcamp}{I co{-}taught an international, week{-}long workshop on combining animal tracking through machine vision methods and 3D graphics applications to build virtual reality systems for freely{-}moving animals.  Besides theoretical lectures on the mathematics and engineering behind virtual reality systems, I wrote tutorials for software I wrote to teach the concepts, from which the participants, consisting of PhD students, Post{-}docs, and Professors, built their own prototype VR systems for ants.}%
\NewEntry{Fall 2017}{Organizer}{PyData Munich}{I revived a local chapter for the global PyData organization, coordinating with technology companies in Munich (e.g. Google, Nokia, TNG Consulting, JetBrains, and Wayra) to build a data{-}science teaching community through the MeetUp platform. These companies now host biweekly tutorials at their event spaces, sponsoring each event and providing spaces for university researchers and tech industry specialists to meet, interact, and learn together.}%
\NewEntry{Summer 2017}{Organizer}{Super Python Talks for Life Science}{I organized a biweekly seminar series for teaching intermediate{-}level data analysis and Python programming tutorials, given by 10 PhD students and Pos{-}docs, including myself.  Besides recruiting these speakers, I organized the room and equipment for these sessions, advertised the events, and ran the sessions.  This series was successful; it was regularly attended by 30{-}70 researchers.}%
\NewEntry{July 2016 and July 2017}{Trainer}{Introduction to Scientific Programming in Python}{This 4{-}day workshop is an intensive version of the semester Python course I teach at LMU.  In this period, students with no programming experience gain the skills needed to perform data analysis and in Python and reason about their analysis workflow.}%
\NewEntry{Summer 2016 and Summer 2017}{Data Science Lecturer}{Introduction to Scientific Programming in Python}{In this semester course, taught two years in a row, I taught beginning programmers data management, scientific data analysis, and programming skills in a new language (Python).  Besides organizing and planning the course, I also prepared all course materials, homework assignments, and graded their final projects.}%
\NewEntry{Winter 2015}{Lecturer}{Introduction to Matlab}{I planned and taught Matlab to beginning proramming students.}%
\NewEntry{December 2015}{Teaching Assistant}{Psychophysics}{In this 2{-}week block course, I provided technical and programming assistance to students programming and analysing their own psychopysics experiments in Matlab, R, and Excel.}%
\SubHeading{Research Experience}%
\NewEntry{May 2013 {-}\newline%
  Present}{Ludwig{-}Maximillians Universität}{Prof. Dr. Anton Sirota}{Programmed a 3D graphics engine in Python to build virtual reality system for freely moving rats, designed and carried out cognitive science experiments testing the generalizability of virtual reality research to its real{-}world counterparts, supervised six students in programming, engineering, and cognitive science projects, organized weekly journal clubs, planned departmental social events and retreats, and ordered new laboratory equipment.}%
\SubHeading{Industry Experience}%
\NewEntry{}{Technical Consultant}{UKT Psychosomatic Med. and Sports Med.}{I evaluated and designed a solution for performing medical science studies in a placebo study, and taught the PhD student who carried out the study over several remote sessions and a few travel consultations.}%
\NewEntry{}{Research Internship}{The Neuromarketing Labs}{I completed set{-}up of an EEG laboratory, including software calibration and noise measurements. Designed and ran two experiments estimating the evoked responses of semantic agreement and price agreement, then analyzed the data. The results from the second experiment are the basis of Dr. Müller’s recently{-}published book, "Neuropricing". Currently volunteering as an EEG consultant by giving one{-}day workshops on Fieldtrip, SPM, and artifact correction methods.}%

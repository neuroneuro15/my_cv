    StartDate: Dec. 2009
    EndDate: Aug. 2010
    Description: Built an NI-DAQ EEG system, programmed online analysis and data acquisition in Matlab and LabView, and confirmed its functionality in three different experiments. As a senior lab assistant, also worked as an aid for rat neurosurgery and noninvasive electrophysiology (skin conductance, EMG, EKG, and EEG) laboratory course sessions, which included planning and giving demonstrations on each method above.
  - Institute: Duke University
    Supervisor: Prof. Dr. Jennifer Groh
    StartDate: June-Aug 2008
